\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This project would not have been possible without the support of many people.
Many thanks to my adviser, Chengxiang Zhai, who read my numerous revisions and
helped make some sense of the confusion. Also thanks to my committee members,
Jiawei Han, David Forsyth, and Joy Zhang, who offered guidance and support.  And
finally, thanks to parents, and numerous friends who endured this long process
with me, always offering support and love.

%% The thesis format requires the Table of Contents to come
%% before any other major sections, all of these sections after
%% the Table of Contents must be listed therein (i.e., use \chapter,
%% not \chapter*).  Common sections to have between the Table of
%% Contents and the main text are:
%%
%% List of Tables
%% List of Figures
%% List Symbols and/or Abbreviations
%% etc.
