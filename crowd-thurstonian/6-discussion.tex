\section{Conclusions and Future Work} \label{sec::tpp_conclude}

In this chapter, we present a novel generative model called ``Thurstonian
Pairwise Preference'' (\textsc{Tpp}) to infer the true ranked list out of a
collection of crowdsourced pairwise annotations, which is highly useful in
various data mining and information retrieval tasks such as \emph{learning to
rank}. \tpp{} resolves the inevitable incompleteness and inconsistency of
pairwise judgements, by carefully modeling variable query difficulty and
different labeling quality resulting from workers' domain expertise and
truthfulness. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that \textsc{Tpp} can effectively bind pairwise preferences of the
crowd into rankings and substantially outperforms previously published methods.
To further explore the benefit from the inferred ranked lists,  it is promising
to extend  \textsc{Tpp} to jointly learn the ranking model of the end
application, which we leave for future work.
