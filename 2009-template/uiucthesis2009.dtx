% \begin{abstract}
% Load the \pkg{uiucthesis2009} class for use with \LaTeX2e
% to produce a document that should conform
% to the format described in
% \emph{Handbook for Graduate Students Preparing to Deposit}\cite{Handbook}. (Actually
% I have checked the requirements from a grad college webpage\cite{thesisweb}.
% I believe 
% this template complies, but there is no guarantee.)
% \end{abstract}
% 
% \section{The User Interface}
%
% This section describes how to use the \pkg{uiucthesis2009} class to
% produce a thesis satisfying the format requirements of the
% Grad College at UIUC.
% I assume that you are familiar with \LaTeX, and highly
% recommend that anyone attempting to use \LaTeX\ to produce a
% thesis have access to a copy of the \LaTeX\ book\cite{Lamport}.
%
% Note that I haven't graduated yet and so I haven't taken this template
% through the ultimate test, which is to actually submit a thesis that ues it.
% I believe this template does conform to the graduate college requirement, but I am,
% \emph{in no way} guaranteeing it conforms to anything.
%
% Also, I'm writing my thesis right now as well. I don't plan to make any more changes to this
% template until I graduate. Hence, if you send me an e-mail right now asking to change some
% detail that you'd think looks better, you're likely to either
% not get a response or receive a somewhat polite ``Wait until january...'' type of response.
% If you firmly believe this template does not conform to the graduate college requirements, be
% very precise and I might look at it. It's just the way it is right now, I'm afraid...
% 
% \subsection{Using \pkg{uiucthesis2009}}
%
% To write a thesis, you load the UIUC thesis definitions
% by loading the \pkg{uiucthesis2009} class at the beginning of
% your \LaTeX\ document with the |\documentclass| command.
% For example,
% \begin{quote} \hrule \begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[edeposit,fullpage]{uiucthesis2009}
% \end{verbatim} \hrule \end{quote}
% \iffalse
%<example>
% \fi
%
% \DescribeMacro{[draftthesis]}
% \DescribeMacro{[fancy]}
% \DescribeMacro{[fullpage]}
% The \pkg{uiucthesis2009} class provides a number of options.
% The |[draftthesis]| option causes each page to have a header
% proclaiming the document to be a draft copy, along with the
% current time and date.
% It also omits the copyright page and prints out any marginal notes
% added with the |\note| macro.
% The |[fancy]| style option produces slightly fancier chapter headings.
% The |[fullpage]| style option makes the margins as small as the
% format requirements allow and uses double-spacing for the text.
% Because wide text columns are generally
% considered harder on the reader
% this is not the default, but is provided as an option because people
% seem to want it.
% The |[fancy]| and |[fullpage]| options are incompatible---choose
% one or the other.
%
% \DescribeMacro{[proquest]}
% The |[proquest]| option is meant to be used when you are ready to deposit your thesis.
% For doctorates, the Grad College requires the submission of a specially
% formatted abstract for the ProQuest publication service. To produce this
% abstract, include the |[proquest]| option and reprocess your file. Everything
% in your \LaTeX\ document will be ignored except the contents of the \env{abstract}
% environment, which are printed out in the format required. Once the option is
% removed from the |\documentclass| command, you can reprocess your thesis as
% normal (the auxiliary files should be intact). To use this option, the name
% of your thesis advisor needs to be specified with the |\advisor| command (see
% below).
%
% \DescribeMacro{[edeposit]}
% Use the |[edeposit]| option if you are depositing your thesis electronically. The title page
% used to be different, but the requirement appears to have been harmonized since. The page 
% numbering is slightly different since the committee
% approval form is not included with your thesis. (The page numbering change is currently the
% only difference of thet edeposit option.  You
% must specify your committee members with the |\committee| command (see below).
%
% \DescribeMacro{[offcenter]}
% The |[offcenter]| option adds 1/2 inch to the left margin of all pages and takes
% away 1/2 inch to the text width, leaving a 1.5in left margin and a 1in right margin.
% I believe this setting satisfies the pre-2009 requirement by the grad college to
% have a 1.5in margin for binding. It should also allow you more room for binding
% if you need it. The new requirement is a minimum 1in margin all around and the 
% |[fullpage]| option without the |[offcenter]| option should achieve this goal.
%
% This can now be done to allow some extra space there for binding purposes, or
% if you use the |[fancy]| option, to allow for more space for the chapter
% numbers at the left side of the page.
% In past versions of \pkg{uiucthesis2009} (the name used was simply uiucthesis)
% , the |[fancy]| option did this by default.
% This version uses symmetric margins by default, even with the
% |[fancy]| option. If you have a lot of chapters (i.e., more than 9), your chapter
% numbers may spill into
% the 1 inch margin required by the Grad College without using this option.
%
% \DescribeMacro{[centerchapter]}
% Normally, the chapter headings are all left-justified on the opening page of
% each chapter. These headings can all be centered by using the |[centerchapter]|
% option for the class. This option is not recommended for use with the |[fancy]|
% option.
%
% \subsection{The Title Page}
%
% The |\maketitle| command is redefined so that it creates a
% title page with the correct format for a thesis at UIUC.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\phdthesis}
% \DescribeMacro{\otherdoctorate}
% \DescribeMacro{\msthesis}
% \DescribeMacro{\othermasters}
% \DescribeMacro{\department}
% \DescribeMacro{\college}
% Use the |\phdthesis| or |\msthesis| to set the correct thesis type.
% If your thesis isn't for a ``Ph.D.'' or ``M.S.'', you can specify
% your degree with either\\
% |\otherdoctorate{|\meta{degree name}|}{|\meta{abbreviation}|}| or\\
% |\othermasters{|\meta{degree name}|}{|\meta{abbreviation}|}|.\\
% For example, specifying |\phdthesis| is equivalent to giving the command\\
% |\otherdoctorate{Doctor of Philosophy}{Ph.D.}|.\\
% The default thesis type is |\phdthesis|. Set your department with\linebreak
% |\department{|\meta{department}|}|. This defines the field your degree
% will be in, so leave out ``Department of.''
% The default department is ``Computer Science''.
% Define your college with |\college{|\meta{college}|}|.
% The default is college is ``Graduate College'';
% you shouldn't need to change it.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\schools}
% Use |\schools{|\meta{school list}|}| to list the previous degrees
% you have received and the schools that you received them from.
% Separate multiple degrees with |\\|.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\degreeyear}
% Use |\degreeyear{|\meta{year}|}| to define the year in which
% you will receive your degree.  The default is the current year.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\advisor}
% \DescribeMacro{\adviser}
% Use |\advisor{|\meta{advisor name}|}| or |\adviser{|\meta{advisor name}|}|
% to specify the name of your
% advisor. This is needed to produce the ProQuest abstract
% (see the |[proquest]| option above). You only need to submit a
% ProQuest abstract if you are a doctoral candidate.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\committee}
% Use |\committee{|\meta{committee members}|}| to specify the members
% of your committee and their titles as you want them to appear on the
% title page. Separate members with |\\|. This is needed for
% all forms of thesis submission. To respect the graduate college guidelines,
% you must use the full title of each committee members. The committee chair should
% appear first with the designation ``,chair''. Your thesis adviser should appear second
% with the title ``,Director of Research''. See the graduate college website for details.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\volume}
% The |\volume| macro provides nominal support for very long theses that must
% be broken up into multiple volumes. Use |\volume{|\meta{number}|}|
% to specify the volume number (a single arabic numeral). All this macro
% does is place the word VOLUME with the number you specify on the title
% page. You have to take care of what appears in each volume. The easiest
% way to do this is to create two separate source files, one for each
% volume.
%
% Here's how to produce an example similar to that in \cite{Handbook}.

%
% \subsection{Front Matter}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\frontmatter}
% Typically, a thesis might have an Abstract, a Dedication, some
% Acknowledgments, and a Preface before the Table of Contents.
% Use the |\frontmatter| command to start this preliminary section
% of the thesis.
% The |\frontmatter| command sets the page number of the next page
% to roman numeral iii (or ii if the |[edeposit]| option is used).
% (The title page is page i, and the certificate
% of committee approval, the ``red-bordered form,'' is page ii.)
%
% \DescribeEnv{abstract}
% The abstract should appear in the \env{abstract} environment. Normally,
% this just produces another chapter with |\chapter*{\abstractname}|,
% where |\abstractname| is ``Abstract'' (see User Customization below),
% but if the |[proquest]| option
% is specified, then the contents of this environment are used
% for the ProQuest abstract.
%
% \DescribeEnv{dedication}
% A dedication page can be printed with the \env{dedication} environment.
% This produces a separate page with the dedication centered horizontally
% and vertically, with the text in italics.
%
% After this front matter comes the Table of Contents,
% List of Tables, List of Figures, etc.  Use the standard \LaTeX\
% commands |\tableofcontents|, |\listoftables|, |\listoffigures|, etc.,
% to generate them.
% In the \pkg{uiucthesis2009} format these lists are all single spaced.
%
% \DescribeEnv{symbollist}
% \DescribeEnv{symbollist*}
% Optionally, these tables can be followed by a List of Abbreviations and/or
% List of Symbols. Introduce these with the |\chapter| command. To aid in
% making these lists, the \env{symbollist} and \env{symbollist*} environments are
% defined in \pkg{uiucthesis2009}. These environments produce a two-column list
% as illustrated below. By default the left column is 1 inch wide but can
% be specified with an optional argument. In the starred environment, the left
% column is left-justified, otherwise it is centered. See the example below.
%
% Here's an example of what the front matter of a typical
% thesis looks like.  First comes the Abstract and the Dedication, both of
% which are optional.
% \begin{quote} \hrule \begin{verbatim}

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This project would not have been possible without the support of
many people. Many thanks to my adviser, Lawrence T. Strongarm, who
read my numerous revisions and helped make some sense of the
confusion. Also thanks to my committee members, Reginald Bottoms,
Karin Vegas, and Cindy Willy, who offered guidance and support.
Thanks to the University of Illinois Graduate College for awarding
me a Dissertation Completion Fellowship, providing me with the
financial means to complete this project. And finally, thanks to
my husband, parents, and numerous friends who endured this long
process with me, always offering support and love.

%% The thesis format requires the Table of Contents to come
%% before any other major sections, all of these sections after
%% the Table of Contents must be listed therein (i.e., use \chapter,
%% not \chapter*).  Common sections to have between the Table of
%% Contents and the main text are:

%
% \DescribeMacro{\mainmatter}
% Begin the main body of your thesis with the |\mainmatter| command.

% You can now use any of the commands defined by the
% the book document class to write your thesis.
%
% In the following example, each of the chapters
% has been broken out into separate files that are inserted into
% this main file with the |\include| command.  This allows the
% thesis to be proofed quickly while it is being revised with
% the |\includeonly| command.  To provide an example of what the
% chapter headings look like, one chapter has been explicitly
% coded. (Try recompiling the example file with the |[fancy]|
% option instead of |[fullpage]| to see the effect.)

\chapter{This world}
\section{Of the Nature of Flatland}


I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but to make its
nature clearer to you, my happy readers, who are privileged to live in
Space.

Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles,
Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining
fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface, but
without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like
shadows--only hard with luminous edges--and you will then have a pretty
correct notion of my country and countrymen.  Alas, a few years ago, I
should have said "my universe:"  but now my mind has been opened to
higher views of things.

In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that
there should be anything of what you call a "solid" kind; but I dare
say you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the
Triangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about as I have described
them.  On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least
so as to distinguish one figure from another.  Nothing was visible, nor
could be visible, to us, except Straight Lines; and the necessity of
this I will speedily demonstrate.

Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and leaning
over it, look down upon it.  It will appear a circle.

But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your
eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the
inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and
more oval to your view, and at last when you have placed your eye
exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually
a Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all,
and will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.

The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way a
Triangle, or a Square, or any other figure cut out from pasteboard.  As
soon as you look at it with your eye on the edge of the table, you will
find that it ceases to appear to you as a figure, and that it becomes
in appearance a straight line.  Take for example an equilateral
Triangle--who represents with us a Tradesman of the respectable class.
Figure 1 represents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were
bending over him from above; figures 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman,
as you would see him if your eye were close to the level, or all but on
the level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level of the
table (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing
but a straight line.

When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar
experiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant
island or coast lying on the horizon.  The far-off land may have bays,
forelands, angles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a
distance you see none of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright
upon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of light
and shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water.

Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other
acquaintances comes towards us in Flatland.  As there is neither sun
with us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none
of the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland.  If our friend
comes closer to us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it
becomes smaller; but still he looks like a straight line; be he a
Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will--a straight
Line he looks and nothing else.

You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantagous circumstances we are
able to distinguish our friends from one another: but the answer to
this very natural question will be more fitly and easily given when I
come to describe the inhabitants of Flatland.  For the present let me
defer this subject, and say a word or two about the climate and houses
in our country.

%
% \subsection{Reference Matter}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\appendix}
% To switch from the body of your thesis to the reference material
% at the end, you should use the standard \LaTeX\ |\appendix| command.
% In \pkg{uiucthesis2009}, there is also a starred version of this command
% that eliminates the lettering of the appendices (use if you have
% a single appendix). Note that if you use |\appendix*| along with
% the |[fancy]| option, you may want to put ``Appendix:'' at
% the beginning of the chapter title.
%
%
% \begin{quote} \hrule \begin{verbatim}
\appendix*

\include{Appendix.tex}
% \end{verbatim} \hrule \end{quote}
% \iffalse
%<example>
% \fi
%
% \subsection{Back Matter}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\backmatter}
% The last few chapters in your thesis should not have chapter
% numbers, but should be listed in the Table of Contents.
% These chapters include the Bibliography, the Index,
% and the Vita.  \LaTeX's |\backmatter| command accomplishes this.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\bibliography}
% Use the standard \LaTeX\ bibliography commands to
% create your bibliography. Most people will use Bib\TeX\ to do this.
% (See \cite{Lamport}). For those in the sciences, you may want to
% check out the \pkg{cite} package (it's pretty standard), which
% will produce numerical citations that are sorted and compressed.
% You can also use the \pkg{natbib} package. Both of these packages
% can do either bracketed citations or superscript citations.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\vita}
% The |\vita| command begins a new chapter for your vita.
% In fact, it does exactly the same thing as |\chapter{\vitaname}|,
% where |\vitaname| is ``Vita.''
%
% \begin{quote} \hrule \begin{verbatim}

%
% \section{User Customization}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\draftheader}
% If you don't like the header that the the |[draftthesis]| option
% creates, you can redefine the |\draftheader| command so that it
% produces whatever text you want.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\thesisspacing}
% The \pkg{uiucthesis2009} class loads \pkg{setspace} for the
% line spacing commands.  See the documentation in that package
% for more information on the commands it provides.
% By default, \pkg{uiucthesis2009} uses one and a half line spacing,
% or double spacing if the |[fullpage]| option is specified.
% If you're unhappy with that, you can override it by redefining the
% |\thesisspacing| command.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\nocopyrightpage}
% Unless the |[draftthesis]| option is used, a page with the copyright notice
% is printed before the title page. If you don't want this page to
% appear, even in the final version, put the |\nocopyrightpage| macro
% somewhere in the preamble.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\toclabels}
% Some departments require the Table of Contents, List of Tables and
% List of Figures to have a ``Page'' heading over the page numbers
% on the first page. This can be accomplished by putting the |\toclabels|
% command somewhere before the |\tableofcontents| command. (NOTE: if you put
% the |\tableofcontents| command in a separate file that you |\include| in
% the main file, the |\toclabels| command must also be in that file.)
%
% \DescribeMacro{\chaptertitlefont}
% \DescribeMacro{\sectiontitlefont}
% \DescribeMacro{\subsectiontitlefont}
% \DescribeMacro{\subsubsectiontitlefont}
% These macros contain the font declarations for the corresponding sectioning
% levels and can be redefined to suit your aesthetic desires. Use
% |\renewcommand| to do this in the preamble.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\chapternumberfont}
% The |\chapternumberfont| macro is really most applicable when the |[fancy]| option is used. It
% specifies the font declaration used for the chapter number set in the left
% margin next to the title. Otherwise it specifies the font used to print
% the words ``Chapter \#'' at the top of each chapter's opening page. Use
% |\renewcommand| to redefine this macro in the preamble.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\chaptertitleheight}
% |\chaptertitleheight| is the amount of space allotted for the chapter title at the top
% of the page. You can redefine it using |\setlength| in the preamble.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\bibname}
% |\bibname| is a standard \LaTeX\ macro that contains the title of the reference
% section at the end of your thesis; ``References'' by default. Use
% |\renewcommand| to redefine it in the preamble.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\vitaname}
% Like |\bibname| but it contains the name used for your vita at the very end.
% The Grad College allows ``Vita'', ``Author's Biography'', or ``Curriculum Vitae'',
% each of which is slightly different in format.  See \cite{Handbook}.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\abstractname}
% Like above, but for the abstract. By default, ``Abstract''.
%
% \DescribeMacro{other "name"s}
% Similarly, the titles for the Table of Contents, List of Figures, and List of Tables
% are stored in the macros |\contentsname|, |\listfigurename|, and |\listtablename|,
% respectively. Their default values are the names in the previous sentence. There are
% also the macros |\chaptername|, |\appendixname|, |\indexname|, |\partname|,
% |\tablename|, and |\figurename| that contain the appellations for chapter and appendix
% headings (not applicable with the |[fancy]| option), the index, parts, tables, and figures.
% Their default values are Chapter, Appendix, Index, Part, Table, and Figure, respectively.
% All of these macros can
% be redefined in the preamble with |\renewcommand|.  These macros are all part of
% the standard \LaTeX\ formalism, they are just included here for the reader's convenience.
% For example, some departments require chapter headings to be in all caps, which can
% be done by changing the |\chaptername| macro to be CHAPTER.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\note}
% This command inserts a marginal note just like |\marginpar| with two distinctions:
% First, the note is single-spaced in a smaller type for compactness.
% Second, it is only printed when
% the |[draftthesis]| option is used. Since marginal notes are not allowed in the final
% draft, the |\note| command is recommended over the |\marginpar| command.
%
% \section{Backwards Compatibility}
%
% Compatibility with previous versions of \pkg{uiucthesis2009} are supported. Previously it
% was implemented as a package rather than a class, in which case you opened the document
% with:
% \begin{quote} \hrule \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass[oneside,...]{book}
% \usepackage[...]{uiucthesis2009}
% \end{verbatim} \hrule \end{quote}
% To provide backwards-compatibility, a style file is provided that has the same functionality
% of the class file described herein. Similarly, (really) old versions of \pkg{uiucthesis2009}
% used the \env{preliminary} and \env{thesis} environments, which are now deprecated
% but backwards-compatibility support is still provided.
%
% \section{Other Issues}
%
% \subsection{Paper Size and PDF Files}
%
% The default paper size for most \LaTeX\ distributions is A4, which is slightly different
% the 8.5 x 11 size for letter paper in the U.S\@. The Graduate College requires theses
% to be letter paper size.  In addition, many departments want soft copies of the thesis
% in PDF format. Unfortunately, the program used to convert the dvi file to PDF format
% (|dvipdfm| on my computer, which is a Windows machine with Mik\TeX installed on it)
% often produces PDF files in A4 format, even if |letterpaper|
% is specifically specified in the your \TeX source file. If you're having this problem,
% either run the PDF conversion utility from the command line with the right flag ---
% for example, |dvipdfm -p letter| on my computer --- or change the default paper size in
% the config file for your PDF conversion utility, which will then fix this problem
% permanently.  On my computer, this can be done by going to the |dvipdfm\config|
% subdirectory off of the main \TeX installation directory (usually |C:\texmf|). In this
% directory is a file called |config| that has a line for the default paper size.

% \subsection{Reference Lists at the Chapter Level}
%
% The \pkg{cite} package includes a style file \pkg{chapterbib.sty} that can be used
% to do a list of references for each chapter instead of just one big list at the
% end of the thesis.  I've not used this style before so you're on your own if you
% want to do this, but I think it is rather straightforward\ldots.

%    This code is a modified version of the code in the 1996/05/26 release
%    of classes.dtx that produces leader dots between the chapter
%    name and the page number.
%
%    This macro formats the entries in the table of contents for
%    chapters. It is very similar to |\l@part|
%
%    First we make sure that if a pagebreak should occur, it occurs
%    \emph{before} this entry. Also a little whitespace is added and a
%    group begun to keep changes local.
%    \begin{macrocode}

    \vskip 1.0em \@plus 0.2em \@minus 0.2em
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    The macro |\numberline| requires that the width of the box that
%    holds the part number is stored in \LaTeX's scratch register
%    |\@tempdima|. Therefore we put it there. We begin a group, and
%    change some of the paragraph parameters.  These are different
%    from the defaults for the standard report or book class.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \setlength\@tempdima{1.5em}

%    \begin{macrocode}
      \leavevmode \bfseries
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Because we do not use |\numberline| here, we have do some fine
%    tuning `by hand', before we can set the entry. We discourage but
%    not disallow a pagebreak immediately after a chapter entry.
%    We use leaders between the chapter title and the page number,
%    unlike the standard report or book class.

%    Then we call upon |\@makechapterhead| to format the actual
%    chapter title. We have to do this in a special way when we are in

%    |\textwidth|. In one column mode we call |\@afterheading|, which
%    takes care of suppressing the indentation.

% For fancy chapter headings, compute the correct height to use for the

% of the chapter title.  If $a$ is the height of the chapter number and $b$ is
% the height of the chapter title, then if we set the chapter number in a
% box of height $b+(a-b)/2=(a+b)/2$ then it aligns correctly.
%
% We arrange for this value to be computed at the beginning of the document
% in case the user loads a style file that changed the default fonts.
%
% In addition, we want the chapter titles to have the same vertical placement
% on the page, regardless whether the chapter is numbered or not. We compute
% the distance we have to skip for chapters without numbers to accomplish this
% and store it in |\thesis@chapskip|.

% \subsection{Page Layout}
%
% First we set the vertical layout.
% Adjust the height of the text column so that it takes up the full
% height of an 8.5 by 11 inch page.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\topmargin=0pt
\advance \topmargin by -\headheight
\advance \topmargin by -\headsep
\textheight 8.9in
%    \end{macrocode}
% Next, set the horizontal layout.
%
% The standard for technical papers seems to be to use
% extremely wide columns of text, and then to increase the spacing between
% lines to compensate for the long lines.
% Unfortunately, because so many papers are typeset this way,
% the format has become self-propagating.
%
% The |[fullpage]| option sets one-inch margins.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\if@fullpage
  \setlength{\textwidth}{\paperwidth}
  \addtolength{\textwidth}{-2in}
  \@settopoint\textwidth
\fi
%    \end{macrocode}
% In the old version of \pkg{uiucthesis2009}, (past versions used the name uiucthesis)
% the ``fancy'' thesis style used
% an asymmetric page layout,
% shifting the text column slightly over to the right to leave
% room for the chapter number to the left of the chapter title. This layout
% is still used if the |[offcenter]| option is given, otherwise symmetric
% margins are used.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\setlength{\@tempdima}{\paperwidth}
\addtolength{\@tempdima}{-\textwidth}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{.5\@tempdima}
\addtolength{\oddsidemargin}{-1in}
\if@thesisoffcenter
  \addtolength{\oddsidemargin}{0.5in}
  \addtolength{\textwidth}{-0.5in}
  \reversemarginpar
\fi
%    \end{macrocode}
% Set |\marginparwidth|, leaving 24pt for the right margin.
% Note that you're not allowed to actually use a marginal paragraph
% this close to the edge in the final version of a thesis, but it is still
% handy for leaving notes to yourself in the draft (with the |\note|
% command, see below).
%    \begin{macrocode}
\setlength{\marginparwidth}{\oddsidemargin}
\addtolength{\marginparwidth}{1in}
\addtolength{\marginparwidth}{-\marginparsep}
\addtolength{\marginparwidth}{-24pt}
%    \end{macrocode}
% Use the same margins for even and odd pages. Use the \LaTeX macro
% |\@settopoint| to truncate arithmetic errors.

\@settopoint\marginparwidth
\setlength{\evensidemargin}{\oddsidemargin}
%    \end{macrocode}

%
% \subsection{Making Notes}
%
% \begin{macro}{\note}
% You can leave yourself marginal notes using the |\note{|\meta{text}|}|
% macro. If the final draft is being printed (i.e., no |[draftthesis]| option)
% then these notes are not printed.
%    \begin{macrocode}

% \subsection{Page Numbering}
